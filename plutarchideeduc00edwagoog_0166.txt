The story is related by our Author at large
in the Life of Lysander. It is thiar-Lysander
sent by Gylippus to the Ephori, or chief Ma·
gistrates of Sparta, a great sum of money scaled

up in bags. Gylippus unsows the bags at the
bottom, and takes out what he thinks fit out

of each bag, and lows them up again: but was
discovered, partly by the notes, which were put
in the bags by Lysander, mentioning the sums
in each bag; and partly by his own servant,
who, when the Magistrates were solicitous to
find what was become of the money that was
wanting, told them jestingly, that there were
a great many Owls under the tiles at his master’s
hou-lc3 (lor the money had that bird, as the
badge of Athens where it was coined, stamped
on it,) whitlr'er they sent and found it.. Ford.

Tooke‚ inhia Diversrons of Purley, (See particularly p. 268.)
has lhewn him to have pollelled but a very ssender knowledge
ol the derivation of his own language. -As Ι have mentioned
the name of Tooke‚ it rnay not be amiss to notice, that
Lennep agrees with him in admitting only two parts of speech,
..the Verb, and the Noun, (SeeLennep, p. 38. Tooke‚ p. 65.)
