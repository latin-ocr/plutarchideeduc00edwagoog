απηγξατο) Lennep (p. 106.) appears by no¹
means to have given an exa& view of Kuster's
treatise on the Middle Verbs, when he sayst- *
Knsterns enim usum horum temporum, quae
¹ verbo medio adscribuntur, tantum respexit, et
iignificandi rationes, in multis, ab adiiva et
pnffloa virtute diversas effe ostendit; deformatione
ipsa nansallicitnse— whereas Kuster. took it far
granted that the form of the middle voice was ⁴
really distin& from that of the adiive and pas-
five3 and upon this faundnion he eredied his dis-
covery (as he calls it‚) of its reciprocal fignifi-

cation; which he contended that this form pos, x

sessed‚ not by virtue of an ellipsts, but by its
INHEREN T FORCE.-That this account is

,aceurate will be evidlent from the following
