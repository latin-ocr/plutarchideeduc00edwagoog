162 NOTAE.

yet that it originally existed would have been

evident stom the paulo postfuturum, τετυψομω,
which most plainly supposes fraudu—rerum.
-ln the poffive voice also (o only being substi-
tuted sor a‚) these two principal tenses are
formed in thelame simple manner.

1 shall close this note with an excellent pas-
sage from Lennep3 in which he justly cautione
us against paying an implicit deserence to the

os Callimachus, which has in vain exercised the ws'ts of the
Critics: Hymn. in Jov. v. 55.

Ernesti ad loc. has sufficiently proved against Dawes that the
common reading is genuine. (ln the verse produced from
Orpheus Ι would by all means read with Ernesti τραφε, in.
stead of neapol-l have observed above, (p. 73.) that a long
vowel before the termination μι arises from a contradison: -
Ihave the satisfadlion os finding that Scheidius (p. 31.) agrees
with me in this: - In transcursu hic observemus adhuc, (says
he,) ex eadem cognatione formarum vicinarum sortasse repe.
tendas esse vocales longos net o, in edom, delum etc. ut, nempe,
σιθημι proprie scriptum srt pro ordorp», islone pro hloopq -As
Sept therefore arises from &ank-so Seu witha single ε would
produce depr· the impersedlum os which would be regularly,
elur, oilie, 192, etc. (See Lennep‚ p. 118.)--ln like manner, as
aegeon is derived stom τςαφημι, and agapam from agapium-so
τςαφιω would generale τςαφεμι, whence ετςαφεν, ετςαφες, rer-gapt, etc.
-Consequently ετςαφες is exadlly the same tense as ετςιφης,

form is not imaginary is evident srorn τςαφει, nutriti frent,
¹(lliad. A. v. 266.) which is said indeed to be Dorice or
AEolice for egaonaav· (hee Maittaire, Dialect. p. 229. Port.

' Royal Gr. Gram. p. 151.) but that a short vowel should pro-

ceed from a long one is utterly absurd: agape» is as much put

sor τςκφισαιν, as erodii ls for nodeca».
