-“ 'Tis true the Greeks in their Imperatives
“ admit certain Tenses of the Past, such as those
“ os the Perfesfum, andos the tivo Aori s.
“ But then these Tenses, when fo applied, either
“ totally lose their temporary Charadter, or esse
“ are used to insmuate such a Speed of execution,
“that the deed should be (as it were) done, in
‘⁸ the very instant when commanded. The same
“ difference seems to subsrst between our English

“ Imperative, BE GON E, and those others os,
“ GO, or BE GOING. The first (if we please)

“ may be stised the imperative of the Persefflum,
‘.‘ as calling in the very instant for the comple·
“ tion of our Commands3 the others may be “
‘.‘ stiled Imperatipes ff the Future, as allowing a
“reasonable time to begin first, and finissr
‘⁸ aster·ward.”-·-Harris’s Hermep p. 156.

, para) The optative mood in each voice of
verbs both in a and μι is properly formed from
the impersedsum by inserting ι before the termi-
natiori*:--thus stom τυπον ia formed τυποιν, -

(SeeScheidius,p.468.}-sromemopnnonapn·
(See Lennep, p. 101.)-· from See», Sam—from
ὃεεμηυ, &repar- That μι in the optative of verbs
in ω is not the original terminarion, is evident,

⁴* This mode os formation in the aftive voice is certainly ¹
mo're simple and uniform than that proposed by Lennep, p. 1262·

-Itr the paffive voice he agrees with me, p. 101.
