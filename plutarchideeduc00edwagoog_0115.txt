therefore as the double consonant fiis concerned, vin κηςυξ may ·

be short.- He seems to be equally wrong in supposrng that v·
in κηςυς might become short by the rejection of the ξε as is the
genitive κηςῡκος did not shew that the v in κηςῦξ was long by
pature: -and upon thir ground he ssrould hare attacked
