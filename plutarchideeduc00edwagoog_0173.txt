NOTAE. 171¹

because it destroys-both the analogy of the
x formation—and the proportion of syllables, ’
which ought to snbsrst between the aliive and
passive voice ; the latter being longer by one syl.
lable than the former. For the same reason I
consider η before r in the optative of verbs in μι
as not a constituent part of the mood.-From
hear by inserting η we have beaw, and by con·
trallion Sayvg--ft'om gaer, ςαειην, Which may
“ clearly he contracted either into ςαιην-οτ-
„yn-from loeo, loayv, which may as clearly be
contracted either into loni-or lyme-from
θεεμην, θεαμην, and by contraffion θειμην· for as
there isa circumflex over the ha, when the ul-
tima admits of it3 bapyv must clearly be ‹te-3
duced from an imperfectum, which has two εε
before the termination.-I would by all means
consider the optative mood as only a tense of
the yitbjunelive. See Monboddo, V. ΙΙ. p. 162:

As Ι have here cited a place of Mr. Dawes's‘ll
book, which 1 have before noticed; (p. ιιι.)
-to prevent any misconstruttton, Ι think
it proper to observe, that Ido not meanto
’ aliern-that the dtstinttion proposed be-
tween the optative and subjunctive mood is in '
irfiff groundless, and that it is not favoured by*

numerous pallages in the Greek writers3- ἡ
